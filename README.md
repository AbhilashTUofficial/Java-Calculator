# Android development

My first android app was an calculator.
Android development allowed me to put every skill i have onto it.
i use my graphics designing skill (adobe xd, adobe illustrator,adobe photoshop) to design the user-interface
and my problem solving skills and programming skills to develope good quality apps.
knowleadge on multiple programming language also helped me very much.
till that day i learn android development i tried  to replace all the apps on my mobile phone
with tha apps that i made and it was an fun process.



THINGS I LEARNED:

	1. I learned how to use android studio to build an app

	2. I learned xml to create my ui(understands about different types of layouts)

	3. I learned about software development in deep and also i learned to put all my 
	   skills into a real working application
